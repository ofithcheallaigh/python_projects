# Strings
# Another useful data type is the string. A string can contain letters, numbers, and symbols.
name = "Ryan"
age = "19"
food = "cheese"

# Set the variable brian on line 3!

brian = "Hello life!"

# #########################################################################
# Escaping characters
# There are some characters which cause problems. As an example:
'There's a snake in my boot!'
# This code breaks because Python thinks the apostrophe in There's ends the string.
# We can use the backslash to fix the problem:
'There\'s a snake in my boot!'
# The string below is broken. Fix it using the escape backslash!

'This isn\'t flying, this is falling with style!'
